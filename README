In order to use this script, first export the AWS credentials enviroment variables, then add the correct .pem file to your ssh agent and call the ansible-playbook on the site.yml file.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='XXX'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='XXX'

ssh-agent bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/keypair.pem

ansible-playbook site.yml
```

This playbook will recognize the right ubuntu hosts because they are tagged with role=webservers or role=dbservers through the AWS interface.

Example scenarios and the way to run them:

 #. Deploying legacy worldmap on the new infrastructure

 #. Deploying GeoNode master branch on the new infrastructure

 #. Deploying a feature branch for testing

 #. Deploying a feature branch that relies on an external service, like solr.

 #. Removing a feature branch that is not needed anymore.
